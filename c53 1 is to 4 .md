● <DOCTYPE html> - This tag basically is used as the declaration. It gives instructions
to the web browser that the web page is written in HTML language.

● <html> - All the HTML code must be written inside the HTML tags. It begins with
<html> and ends with </html>. So, all the HTML code will come between this
opening and closing tag.

● <head> - After writing the HTML tags, next we write the head tags. These tags are
used to provide the header information of the webpage, such as title

● <title> - We mention the title of the web page inside the <title> tag. As this is the
header information of the webpage, we mention it inside the header tags. This tag
also begins with an opening <title> tag and closing <title> tag.
We are setting the title of our web page as “My First Portfolio” inside the <title></title> tag and also closing the </head> tag


● <body> - This is the most important tag of all the other tags. The body tag contains
the actual body of the webpage which the user can see. 
This tag starts with <body> and ends with </body>. 

All the content enclosed within this tag, such as images,links, audios, videos, will be shown on the web page.

<title>My Portfolio Page </title>


Now we can write any kind of content inside
the <body> tags on the Html page.

It provides a space between a group of
text and the next group of text.
Paragraphs are marked by opening(<p>)
and closing(</p>) tags.

<p>Hey, I'm a paragraph</p>

*Name some features of any website*

Features like images, videos, hyperlinks, forms, etc., can be added to our website.

<img> - This tag is used to add the images to our web page. This tag does not have a
closing tag.
Syntax:
<img src=“”>
Here, the src is the source of the image, basically the location. That is the URL link of
the image, which we are using on the web page.
Before adding an image tag, let’s learn how to add the image from our drive into the project.



<img src="fb.png" alt="Image description" />


Hyperlinks can connect to local web pages or external web pages. To add navigation to
your website you will need to add hyperlinks that connect your individual web pages. You
can add hyperlinks to your web page using the <a> element. The text you want to display as
the hyperlink goes between the opening and closing hyperlink tags.
Let’s create a hyperlink for the image which we have added.


<a href="fb.html">  <img src="fb.png" alt="Image description" /></a>
